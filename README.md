Written Report for Py City Schools Data

Summary of the Analysis:

This data looks at the performance of students from years 9 - 12 from 15 different schools. The data collected was used to indicate whether certain factors of the school (such as school type, number of students, and total school budget) affected students' maths and reading scores. 

Conclusions From The Data:
1. Independent schools scored higher overall in average scores and percentage passed in reading and maths compared to government schools. The data suggests that Independent schools produce higher-scoring students in maths and reading. 
2. The two lowest-performing schools (by % overall passing) had more budget allocated per student and a larger amount of students overall than the two top-performing schools. This indicates that a higher allocation of budget per student does not reflect high maths and reading scores.
